# Doctor Rating Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting doctor ratings based on patient reviews using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Word2Vec embeddings.

## About

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately predict doctor ratings based on the text reviews provided by patients. The model utilizes a combination of natural language processing techniques and deep learning algorithms to analyze the textual data and make predictions.

The dataset used for training and evaluation is from online. It consists of a collection of patient reviews, along with their corresponding ratings. The model is trained to learn patterns and relationships between the text content and the associated ratings, enabling it to make predictions on unseen data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- tensorflow
- scikit-learn
- gensim

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 75.86% on the test dataset. This performance can be further improved by tuning hyperparameters, increasing the dataset size, or using more advanced techniques.
